This application is created as a open source content management system where students and teachers can interact with each other. Instructors can upload their courses whereas students can watch the videos and interact with the instructors. Work is currently under progress and we have launched an initial site called PythonSinhala (https://pythonsinhala.com) using this codebase. PythonSinhala is primarily aimed at providing Sri Lankan students the support they need to prepare for standerdized exams such as [GCE Advanced Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level_in_Sri_Lanka). 

It's our hope to improve the codebase inorder to create a full fledged web application that could be leveraged to host a content management website for all purposes such as a [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). 

For instructions on how to build and run the project please refer to our [Development Documentation](https://github.com/python-sinhala-education-society/OnlineTutor/blob/master/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md).
